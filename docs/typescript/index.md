# Use Celesto from TypeScript

The TypeScript SDK lets a Node.js agent create and control a disposable computer on the same machine. It needs no cloud account, API key, or manually managed server.

> **Alpha:** Node.js 20.4 or newer is supported on Linux x64 and Apple Silicon macOS. The SDK API can be type-checked elsewhere, but the runtime is not yet supported there.

## Set up

Install the Celesto runtime, the preview package, and a TypeScript runner:

```bash
pip install 'celesto[server]==0.0.15a0'
celesto setup
celesto doctor
npm install https://github.com/CelestoAI/Celesto/releases/download/typescript-v0.1.0-preview.1/celestoai-celesto-0.1.0-preview.1.tgz
npm install --save-dev tsx
```

The separate TypeScript preview retains its `@celestoai/celesto` package name
and `Celesto` class. Set `runtimePath: "celesto"` as shown below to use this alpha
release of the Python runtime.

The SDK starts a private local bridge on first use. Each client gets an isolated sandbox list and a random credential passed through a private process pipe. `close()` removes that client's sandboxes and stops the bridge.

## Manage the lifecycle

Lead with `try/finally` so cleanup also runs after an error:

```ts
import { Celesto } from "@celestoai/celesto";

const celesto = new Celesto({ runtimePath: "celesto" });
const sandbox = await celesto.sandboxes.create(); // Ubuntu, open network

try {
  const result = await sandbox.exec(["uname", "-a"]);
  console.log(result.stdout);
} finally {
  await celesto.close();
}
```

`sandbox.delete()` and `celesto.close()` are idempotent. `Symbol.asyncDispose` is also installed when the running Node version supports it, but the alpha documentation uses `try/finally` for compatibility and clarity.

The first sandbox may need to download an image. Creation has a 10-minute deadline by default; set `createTimeoutMs` on `Celesto` when a slower connection needs more time.

## Run commands

Pass an argv array when every argument is already known. It avoids adding an extra login-shell wrapper:

```ts
const result = await sandbox.exec(["python3", "-c", "print('hello')"], {
  cwd: "/workspace",
  env: { MODE: "test" },
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
});

if (!result.ok) console.error(result.stderr);
```

A string intentionally uses the guest login shell, so pipes, redirects, and variable expansion work. A command that exits nonzero still resolves with `ok: false`; bridge, lifecycle, timeout, and abort failures throw.

## Read and write files

```ts
await sandbox.files.write("/workspace/input.txt", "hello");
const text = await sandbox.files.read("/workspace/input.txt");

await sandbox.files.upload("./prompt.txt", "/workspace/prompt.txt");
await sandbox.files.download("/workspace/result.json", "./artifacts/result.json");
```

Paths inside the sandbox must be absolute. Uploads send bytes to the bridge rather than exposing a host path. Downloads write a temporary file beside the destination and rename it atomically.

## Start a browser session from a source checkout

The source tree includes the browser-session API planned for the next TypeScript preview. It is not included in `0.1.0-preview.1`, so use the checked-out `ts/` package until a newer preview is published.

```ts
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";
import { Celesto } from "@celestoai/celesto";

const celesto = new Celesto({ runtimePath: "celesto" });
const session = await celesto.browsers.create({
  mode: "live",
  profile: { mode: "ephemeral" },
  network: { mode: "open" },
});

try {
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(session.cdpUrl);
  const context = browser.contexts()[0];
  if (!context) throw new Error("Browser context is unavailable.");
  const page = context.pages()[0] ?? await context.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  console.log(session.viewerUrl);
  await browser.close();
} finally {
  await celesto.close();
}
```

Use `mode: "headless"` when no live viewer is needed. A browser session also provides `exec(...)` for running a command as the unprivileged `agent` user inside that browser VM. On timeout, Celesto attempts to delete the affected session and reports whether cleanup was confirmed.

## Start a complete Linux computer

Use a computer when the agent needs a visible desktop with Chromium, a terminal, a file manager, and a text editor. The grouped properties keep screen control separate from browser automation:

```ts
const computer = await celesto.computers.create();

console.log(computer.display.viewerUrl);
console.log(computer.browser.cdpUrl);
```

Closing Chromium does not delete the computer. Open it again explicitly:

```ts
await computer.browser.launch();
```

The computer also provides `exec(...)` and `files`. See the [Linux computers guide](../guides/computers.md) for the complete lifecycle and resource chooser.

## Limit network access

The default is `{ mode: "open" }`. Security-focused agents can turn access off or allow only IPv4 ranges:

```ts
await celesto.sandboxes.create({ network: { mode: "off" } });

await celesto.sandboxes.create({
  network: {
    mode: "restricted",
    allowedCidrs: ["203.0.113.0/24"],
  },
});
```

Celesto validates the policy before it downloads an image. Backend-specific restrictions still apply; an unavailable combination throws `CelestoError` with a stable code.

## Cancel a command

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 1_000);

await sandbox.exec("sleep 60", { signal: controller.signal });
```

On abort, the SDK asks the bridge to delete the sandbox and waits for confirmation. If that fails, it closes the complete SDK session instead. The resulting `command_aborted` error says which outcome occurred. Runtime timeouts use the same conservative sandbox-deletion rule.

## Handle errors and diagnose setup

```ts
import { CelestoError } from "@celestoai/celesto";

try {
  await sandbox.exec(["python3", "job.py"]);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof CelestoError) {
    console.error(error.code, error.message);
    if (error.recoveryCommand) console.error(error.recoveryCommand);
  }
}

console.log(await celesto.diagnose());
```

Diagnostics contain versions, platform support, and protocol compatibility. They never include the bridge credential. Construct the client with `{ debug: true }` to retain non-enumerable error causes during local development.

If the installed runtime predates TypeScript SDK sessions, startup fails with `protocol_incompatible` and points to the installer command instead of reporting a generic bridge crash.

## Use in CI

Package type-checks can run on any Node platform. Tests that boot a VM should run only on a supported, hardware-enabled runner. Always close the client in `finally`, and give the job permission to use the selected virtualization backend.

The [Vercel AI SDK tool example](../../ts/examples/vercel-ai-tool.ts) adds schema validation and explicit command approval. The [versioned API reference](api/0.1/README.md) is generated from the SDK source.

Release candidates can record cold and warm lifecycle timings with `npm run benchmark:release` from the `ts/` directory. It emits one JSON record per run with wall time and event phase timestamps; no report is sent anywhere.

## Current limits

The browser-session API documented above is currently available only from a source checkout and will ship in the next TypeScript preview. Persistent sandboxes, snapshots, exposed ports, remote engines, streaming command output, Bun, Deno, and browser runtimes are not part of `0.1.0-preview.1`. SDK sessions do not list or control sandboxes created by the CLI or another SDK client.
