# QEMU incremental snapshot spike

Instead of copying an entire virtual disk every time, this feature can save only the disk areas that changed since the previous snapshot. These smaller files are called disk increments. To restore one, Celesto combines the original full copy with its ordered increments and produces a self-contained bootable disk, so the original virtual machine and host are not needed. The local and production-image tests passed.

## Test baseline

- Celesto source: `38c962f8afd89cc0fcbada5d437b3632eeba790b`
- Local host: macOS arm64
- Local QEMU and `qemu-img`: 11.0.0
- Production image preflight: Ubuntu 24.04, QEMU 8.2.2 (`1:8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1.17`), Linux 6.17 AWS x86_64
- Bitmap granularity (the smallest disk-change unit QEMU tracks): 64 KiB

The production preflight found five running QEMU processes. No disk workload was run on that busy host. A diskless `-machine none` QMP check confirmed that QEMU 8.2.2 exposes every required bitmap, transaction, backup, job, and block-node command.

## Proven locally

`tests/test_qemu_incremental_spike.py` uses a real QEMU process and proves:

- one transaction adds an enabled persistent bitmap and starts the full backup;
- increment A contains only writes made after the base;
- increment B contains writes made after increment A;
- `qemu-img rebase -u` plus `qemu-img convert` produces a standalone qcow2;
- a clean QEMU restart preserves the persistent bitmap;
- forced cancellation leaves all 16 MiB of dirty writes in the bitmap;
- the next successful increment contains the cancelled job's writes.

`tests/e2e/test_qemu_incremental_snapshot.py` uses a disposable Ubuntu VM and proves:

- base+A boots with marker A and without marker B;
- base+A+B boots with both markers;
- both restores work after the source VM, managed disk, QMP socket, and Celesto state are deleted;
- both materialized outputs are standalone qcow2 files.

Local artifact allocation from the boot test:

| Artifact | Virtual size | Allocated bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| Base | 4 GiB | 479,985,664 |
| Increment A | 4 GiB | 917,504 |
| Increment B | 4 GiB | 983,040 |

This idle marker workload demonstrates the artifact shape; the production-image benchmark below measures the byte-reduction target under active writes.

## Compatibility finding

Forced cancellation previously sent `force` to generic `job-cancel`. QEMU 11 rejects that argument. Forced block-backup cancellation now uses `block-job-cancel` with `device` and `force=true`; normal cancellation still uses generic `job-cancel`.

## Interrupted capture recovery

If Celesto reports a recovered artifact, first adopt it into the remote snapshot chain using the `artifact_path` and metadata in the error details. Only after that succeeds, clear the retained local file and recovery record:

```bash
celesto sandbox snapshot delete <recovered-snapshot-id>
```

Do not run the delete command before adoption because it removes the recovered artifact. If Celesto reports that capture state is uncertain, discard that chain and run the fresh full-disk snapshot command included in the error.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_qmp.py tests/test_qemu_incremental_spike.py tests/test_snapshot_qemu.py
uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_qemu_incremental_snapshot.py
uv run python scripts/qemu_incremental_benchmark.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/qemu-incremental-benchmark \
  --intervals 12 \
  --write-mib 32
```

## Production-image result

The tests ran on an isolated `c5.metal` instance launched from the existing production AMI. No new AMI was created, no production user-data was supplied, and the host agent remained disabled. The instance and its root volume were terminated after the run.

QEMU 8.2.2 with KVM passed:

- the focused QMP, cancellation, and snapshot suite: 51 tests;
- source-state deletion and boot of both materialized leaves;
- 12 simulated five-minute intervals with 32 MiB of active guest writes per interval.

Benchmark result:

| Measurement | Result |
|---|---:|
| Repeated standalone full bytes | 6,188,171,264 |
| Base plus 12 increments | 857,145,344 |
| Byte reduction | **86.15%** |
| Increment capture duration | 0.03–0.13 seconds |
| Full capture duration | 2.65–3.74 seconds |
| Baseline terminal latency, median | 45.12 ms |
| During-capture terminal latency, median | 21.45 ms |

The accelerated 12-interval run validates bytes and immediate latency. The 24-hour live canary in the rollout plan remains the long-duration operational test. Disk-heavy benchmarks must not run on a host serving customer VMs.
